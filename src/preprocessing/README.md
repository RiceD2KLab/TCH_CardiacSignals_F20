# Preprocessing

Preprocessing of the raw input ECG data is a three step process:
1. `noise_filtering.py`
2. `heartbeat_split.py`
3. `normalize_heartbeats.py`

## Noise Filtering
To remove noise present in the raw heartbeat data run `noise_filtering.py` \
This filters the data to remove both the wandering baseline present in lead data as well as high frequency noise that
can be an artifact of the ECG leads that generate the data. \
This is done using forward-backward filtering to ensure that there is no phase delay created by the filtering process.


## Heartbeat Split
To split the ECG leads into individual heartbeats, run `heartbeat_split.py` \
This will split the ECGs for each patient into individual heartbeats, interpolate them, and store them into numpy arrays\
The interpolated hearbeats will be stored into a `Working_Data` directory at the root of the project (ignored by the .gitignore)
python3 h5_interface.py [idx] --Duration [seconds] --Offset [seconds]

idx - number of the h5 file you want to read\
Duration - how many seconds to plot (<10 to fit on screen)\
Offset - How many seconds from the beginning of the signal to splice from\

ex. `python3 h5_interface.py 1 --Duration 4 --Offset 3`

## Normalize Heartbeats

To ensure that all heartbeat data is of the same dimension, run `normalize_heartbeats.py` \
This takes all heartbeats generated by `heartbeat_split.py` and linearly interpolates the individual heartbeats or 
groups of heartbeats to the same dimension, so that it can be effectively passed into other models in the pipeline.
