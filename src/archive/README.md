This directory contains Python files and Jupyter notebooks that contain various processes that have been shelved for next
semester. These functions generally concern other modeling methods (for example: Variation Autoencoders) that we may 
continue to use in the future, but are not quite done. As a result, these functions are not used in any part of our pipeline
and are only stored really as a reference if we feel we want to readdress any of these ideas in the future. This is 
unlikely as our resulting pipeline was successful, but we are keeping the files around just in case.

This directory also includes other in progress files for ideas outside of our initial pipeline, including accounting for
cardiopulmonary interactions, and other statistical tests for validation of our instability metric.
