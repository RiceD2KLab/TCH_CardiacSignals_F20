# Data Exploration

The following Python files generate plots for visualizing the ECG data in various ways, as well as visualizing lower 
dimensional representations of the data

## Raw Data Visualizations 

- `ecg_signal_animation.py`  - 
- `histograms.py` - 
- `stft_visualizations.py` - 

## Lower Dimensional Representations
- `pca.py` - runs PCA on original data and reduces data to 1 dimension, saving the encoded and reconstructed files 
- `umap.py` - plots 2-dimensional representation of the PCA matrix for a particular lead of the ith file
